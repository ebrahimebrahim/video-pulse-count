- allow user tuning of peak prominence (or w/e parameter) after signal is generated and before program exit

- come up with a better parameter to play with than peak prominence... the issue is that the effect of peak prominence on results depends on number of frames,
  which doesn't allow user to tinker with small number of frames and expect the results to scale up nicely.
